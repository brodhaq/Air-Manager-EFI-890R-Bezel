## Features
* Simple bezel to be placed around the display unit if using for example on touchscreen trainers. Not practical when using on actual home cockpit hardware.
* Buttons are currently not simulated. Can be added if needed

## Installation of official Release version
If there is an official Release version of this instrument available, you can download it by clicking the link in the Releases section. It will download a <i>.siff</i> file — that is the instrument. Use Air Manager’s "Import" function to import this instrument.

If there is no official Release version of this instrument available, it is usually because it is still in development. In that case, read further.

## Installation from GitHub source
Click **Code → Download ZIP**. The download will begin for a ZIP archive (e.g. xxxyyy.zip).
When the download is finished, open the ZIP file and you will find a subfolder inside with a similar name.
This subfolder should include the files <i>logic.lua</i>, a folder named <i>resources</i>, and possibly other files.
Go to your <code>C:\Users\username\Air Manager\instruments\OPEN_DIRECTORY</code> and create a folder named <b>57e4618f-c64a-4e0b-a5db-68dc65410090</b> (that is your Air Manager hash for this instrument). Copy all the files you just downloaded (<i>logic.lua</i>, the <i>resources</i> folder, etc.) directly into this hash folder. Then run Air Manager, which should immediately discover this new instrument.
